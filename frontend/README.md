## Explanation

It's not finished yet!! (I'm working on it, to use the back-end that's already finished)
(To use and test the Appliaction, you will need to use AppGoBarberNodeJs-BackEnd, the link to the back-end from my repository:https://github.com/MarcusMartins38/AppGoBarberNodeJs-BackEnd)

-Before test the Application, you need to run on Back-end the command " yarn dev:server "

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
